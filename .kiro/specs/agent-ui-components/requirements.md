# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a comprehensive UI component library inspired by shadcn/ui and Radix primitives, specifically designed for agent-to-agent protocol interactions. The library will provide developers with pre-built, customizable components for displaying tasks, artifacts, and other agent communication blocks in a consistent and accessible manner.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer building agent-based applications, I want a comprehensive UI component library built on shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, so that I can quickly implement consistent and professional interfaces for agent interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer installs the library THEN the system SHALL provide access to all core agent UI components built on shadcn/ui foundation
2. WHEN a developer imports components THEN the system SHALL follow shadcn/ui patterns and conventions for seamless integration
3. WHEN components are styled THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS classes and shadcn/ui design tokens
4. WHEN components are used THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and behavior across all components
5. IF a developer needs customization THEN the system SHALL allow theme overrides through Tailwind CSS configuration and CSS variables

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want task-related UI components, so that I can display agent tasks with proper status indicators and progress tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a task THEN the system SHALL show task title, description, status, and progress
2. WHEN a task status changes THEN the system SHALL update the visual indicators accordingly
3. WHEN tasks have subtasks THEN the system SHALL display hierarchical relationships clearly
4. IF a task has time constraints THEN the system SHALL display timing information appropriately
5. WHEN tasks are interactive THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate action buttons and controls

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want artifact display components, so that I can show the outputs and results generated by agent tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying artifacts THEN the system SHALL support multiple content types (text, code, images, files)
2. WHEN artifacts are large THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate scrolling and pagination
3. WHEN artifacts contain code THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting and copy functionality
4. IF artifacts are downloadable THEN the system SHALL provide download controls
5. WHEN artifacts have metadata THEN the system SHALL display creation time, size, and type information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want communication block components, so that I can display agent-to-agent messages and protocol exchanges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying agent messages THEN the system SHALL clearly identify the sender and receiver
2. WHEN messages contain structured data THEN the system SHALL format the content appropriately
3. WHEN message threads exist THEN the system SHALL show conversation flow and relationships
4. IF messages have attachments THEN the system SHALL display them inline or as downloadable items
5. WHEN messages have timestamps THEN the system SHALL display them in a user-friendly format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the component library to be accessible and follow modern web standards, so that my applications can be used by all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
2. WHEN users navigate with keyboards THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus management
3. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
4. IF users have visual impairments THEN the system SHALL support high contrast and custom themes
5. WHEN components are interactive THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback for all user actions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to integrate seamlessly with existing React applications, so that I can adopt it incrementally without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating the library THEN the system SHALL work with existing React applications (16.8+)
2. WHEN using TypeScript THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive type definitions
3. WHEN bundling applications THEN the system SHALL support tree-shaking for optimal bundle sizes
4. IF developers use CSS frameworks THEN the system SHALL not conflict with existing styles
5. WHEN components are used THEN the system SHALL follow React best practices and patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want interactive input components for task feedback collection, so that I can handle scenarios where agent tasks need user input or confirmation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent tasks require user feedback THEN the system SHALL display appropriate input forms and controls
2. WHEN collecting different input types THEN the system SHALL support text, selections, confirmations, and file uploads
3. WHEN input is required THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate required fields and validation rules
4. IF input validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and guidance
5. WHEN input is submitted THEN the system SHALL provide loading states and confirmation feedback
6. WHEN tasks request approval THEN the system SHALL provide clear approve/reject controls with context

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can quickly understand and implement the components correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear API references for all components
2. WHEN learning to use components THEN the system SHALL include practical code examples
3. WHEN exploring functionality THEN the system SHALL provide interactive Storybook stories
4. IF developers need customization guidance THEN the system SHALL include theming and styling documentation
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide common usage patterns and best practices
